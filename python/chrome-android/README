Naming Rules for MOUDLE_COMBO (top level):
MODULE_COMBO: <TARGET_OS>-<TARGET_ARCH>-<MODULE>
TARGET_OS: android, linux, etc.
TARGET_ARCH: x86, arm, x86_64, etc.
MODULE: chrome, content_shell, webview, etc.
For example, if you want to find MODULE_COMBO such as "x86 Chrome for Android", you just need to pay a visit at android-x86-chrome.


Naming Rules for MODULE_COMBO "Chrome for Android":
VERSION_COMBO: <VERSION>-<VERSION_TYPE>
VERSION: An combination of <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<BUILD>.<PATCH>. E.g.,
36.0.1985.128.
<VERSION_TYPE>: stable, beta, etc.
In each VERSION_COMBO directory, Chrome.apk is the one acquired directly from Google Play, Chromium.apk is the one repacked by ourselves, while libchromexxx.so is the one with symbols.


If the specific apk is missed (might happen for x86 as we can not get old apks), a simple Null.apk will be placed at the specific directory.




history:

20140807: Skip the build of arm/34.0.1847.45-beta, arm/34.0.1847.114-stable and x86/34.0.1847.62-beta due to build issues. These are quite old versions so we don't put more effort on them.
